You must self-isolate. You do not need to be tested for COVID-19.

Because you have symptoms, you must self-isolate for 10 days from when your symptoms started and until they are resolved. If your symptoms resolve prior to the 10 days, you must continue to self-isolate because you may still be infectious.

	Please do not visit a hospital, physician’s office, lab or healthcare facility without consulting on the helpline (click here) first.
	Don't go to any public places.
	Stay at home, and don’t have any visitors.
	Don’t share personal items like dishes, utensils, and towels.
	Wash your hands often.
	Avoid close contact with other people, especially those with chronic conditions, a compromised immune system, or seniors (over 65 years of age).


Encourage members of your family to practice social distancing.
